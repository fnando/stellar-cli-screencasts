The most important tool in this process is ffmpeg, which allows us to manipulate video and audio files in various ways.

For instance, we generate the intro and outro segments.

We also process each segment individually to apply fades and generate videos out of images.

The backtrack audio is also processed to apply fades based on the final video duration.

Once we have everything ready, we use ffmpeg one last time to combine them into a single video file.
