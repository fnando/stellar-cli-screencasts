Welcome to Stitch, the tool that makes creating screencasts easy and fun!

Stitch is a command line tool that allows you to create professional-quality screencasts by combining screen recordings, audio narration, and images.

Stitch is just two scripts written in Ruby and Node JS that use FFMpeg under the hood to do all the heavy lifting.
