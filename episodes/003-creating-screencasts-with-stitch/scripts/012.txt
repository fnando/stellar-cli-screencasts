Once your have all your content ready to go, it's time to create your screencast.

The easiest way is by running the Docker image with all the dependencies pre-installed, but in this example we're going to run the stitch script directly.

The screencast generation can take a while depending on the length of your content, so be patient.

Once the export is finished, you can check the output folder for your generated screencast video file.
