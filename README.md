# Screencast generator for Stellar CLI

This repository contains a simple tool to generate screencasts for the Stellar
Command Line Interface (CLI). The tool captures terminal commands and their
outputs, creating a visual representation of how to use the Stellar CLI
effectively.

## Dependencies

- FFMPEG: Used for video processing and encoding.
- VHS: A tool for recording terminal sessions.
- Ruby: Required to run the screencast generation script.
- Node.js: Required to run the ElevenLabs API client.
- [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/app/developers/api-keys) API key set as
  `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` env var.

### macOS

You can use brew:

```bash
brew install ffmpeg vhs ruby nodejs
```

## Usage

```bash
$ ./bin/stitch --help
Usage: bin/stitch [export|new]

$ ./bin/stitch export --help
Exports an episode to a final video file.

    -d, --dir=DIR                    The episode directory
    -f, --force                      Overwrite existing files
        --vhs                        Regenerate VHS, even if --force hasn't been set

$ ./bin/stitch new --help
Creates a new episode directory.

    -t, --title=TITLE                The episode title
```

### Anatomy of an Episode Directory

An episode directory should contain the following files:

- `scripts/`: contains all the scripts for the episode. Each paragraph should be
  its own file.
- `taps/`: contains all the VHS terminal recordings for the episode.
- `audio/`: contains all the voiceovers (.mp3 file) generated by ElevenLabs
- `setup.sh`: a script to setup the environment before running the episode.
- `title.txt`: the title of the episode. Linebreaks control how the title will
  appear.
